His caravan includes scholars, soldiers, and fellow merchants, each with their own hidden agendas and closely guarded secrets.\n\nAs Li Wei navigates the complex web of trade relationships and political alliances that define the medieval world, he discovers that the greatest treasures aren't always made of gold and silk, but of knowledge, friendship, and the courage to bridge different worlds."

The letters pile up in my desk drawer, unread save by my own eyes, but somehow necessary.\n\nYou would find the world much changed since your passing. The war has ended, but its scars remain etched upon the landscape and the hearts of those who survived. I often walk the paths we once traveled together, and I swear I can hear your laughter carried on the wind.\n\nThese letters have become my confession, my diary, my attempt to make sense of a world that seems less bright without your presence. In writing to you, I write to that part of myself that died with you, and perhaps, in some small way, I keep both of us alive."

Each passenger represents a story‚Äîlovers reuniting, families separating, adventurers setting off toward unknown horizons.\n\nI have seen marriages begin with nervous young men waiting on the platform with flowers, and I have seen them end with bitter partings and tears that stain the wooden boards. I have watched children grow from babes in arms to adults with children of their own, marking the passage of time in the rhythm of arrivals and departures.\n\nThis station has been the stage for countless human dramas, and I, the silent observer, have collected these stories like a scholar collects books. Now, in my final year before retirement, I feel compelled to share what I have learned about the human heart from my perch in this small corner of the world."
